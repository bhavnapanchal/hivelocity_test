About this test:

The candidate who develops this test must show his autonomous development skills, thinking about the scalability of the product and how to make improvements on the current code delivery by finding and fixing errors, making sure to use properly Github (Issues Function), also we expect that the candidate write a report and comment on the code about the problems found in the code. 

Key Points
- Find and Fix bugs in the code. (see the image added)
- Make sure to create an issue on GitHub and describe the error properly.
- Write a report about the bugs you have found and also explain how you fix them.
- Explain your readme other additional functions you have to add to this test to make it more fun or useful and explain what you think that could be good.

Additional

- Explain how you could improve this test to see in action developers skills and write why you think "that" will be better.

Timeline and extra points
- 4 days to finish this test, make sure to send your Github Project, remember we also will check your commits and the Github issues you have created for each bug.
- We will consider a lot your code skills they need to be clean and clear (add necessary comments to the code for this) and the way you write your documentation so other engineers can understand.
